## "Expenses Manager" Angular & NGRX8 Demo - Codemomtion 2019

A simple application created in Angular 8 and NGRRX 8 to demonstrate how NGRX works and how to handle:

* store `forRoot` and `forFeatures` 
* actions
* reducers 
* effects
* selectors

## USAGE

1) Clone this repository
2) `npm install`
3) `npm start`
4) Open another terminal and run a REST Mock server: `npm run server`

## NOTES:

This application is not completed and there are missing parts:

* Authentication is fake
* Some reducers must be completed
* Folder structure is simplified and not fully compliants with Angular's best practices
